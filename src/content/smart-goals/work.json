      "question": "How do I align my personal SMART goals with company OKRs?",
      "answer": "Check your company's quarterly OKRs and find where your role connects. If the company wants 15% better customer retention, your goal might be cutting support response time from 24 to 12 hours. Check in with your manager quarterly to make sure you're still aligned."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many professional SMART goals should I set at once?",
      "answer": "3-5 goals per quarter is plenty. More than that and you're spreading yourself too thin. Pick the ones with the biggest impact and focus there. Quality beats quantity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I use SMART goals in performance reviews?",
      "answer": "Set goals with your manager at the start of the review period. Check progress at mid-year with actual numbers. At year-end, show concrete results tied to your measurable criteria. This makes reviews way less awkward — you've got data, not opinions."
