  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How do I balance academic SMART goals with extracurricular activities?",
      "answer": "Set 2-3 academic goals and max 1-2 extracurricular goals. Use a calendar to block time for each. Best case: your activities support your academics (debate club helps with presentations). Review weekly and adjust if one area is suffering."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many SMART goals should a student set per semester?",
      "answer": "3-4 goals max. Try 2 academic (specific courses or study skills), 1 skill development (coding, language), and 1 personal/extracurricular. First-year students should start with just 2-3 while adjusting to college. Quality over quantity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best way to track progress on student SMART goals?",
      "answer": "Use a simple spreadsheet or app like Notion to log metrics (study hours, test scores). Do a quick weekly check on Sundays — 15 minutes to see if you're on track. Having a study buddy to check in with helps too."
