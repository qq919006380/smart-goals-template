    {
      "question": "How do I align my personal SMART goals with company OKRs?",
      "answer": "Start by reviewing your organization's quarterly or annual OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). Identify which company objectives relate to your role, then create SMART goals that directly contribute to those outcomes. For example, if a company OKR is to increase customer retention by 15%, your SMART goal might be to reduce customer support response time from 24 to 12 hours. Schedule regular check-ins with your manager to ensure continued alignment as priorities shift."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many professional SMART goals should I set at once?",
      "answer": "For optimal focus and achievement, limit yourself to 3-5 SMART goals per quarter or 5-7 for the entire year. This prevents overwhelm while allowing you to address multiple aspects of your professional development. Prioritize goals by impact and urgency, and ensure you have adequate time and resources to pursue each one. Quality and completion are more valuable than quantity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I use SMART goals in performance reviews?",
      "answer": "Document your SMART goals at the beginning of each review period and share them with your manager for alignment. During mid-year or quarterly check-ins, present specific progress metrics and any obstacles encountered. At annual reviews, demonstrate achievement with concrete data from your measurable criteria. This structured approach provides clear evidence of your contributions and makes performance discussions more productive and objective."
