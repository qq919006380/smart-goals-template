    {
      "question": "What does SMART stand for in goal setting?",
      "answer": "SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. It's a framework from 1981 that gives you clear criteria for setting goals that actually work. Instead of saying \"I want to get fit,\" you'd say \"I'll run a 5K in under 30 minutes by June.\" Much clearer, right?"
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I review my SMART goals?",
      "answer": "Depends on the goal. For short-term stuff (under 3 months), check in weekly. For bigger goals, a quick weekly check plus a deeper monthly review works well. The key is consistency — pick a day and stick to it. Sunday evenings work great for most people."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I change my SMART goals once I've set them?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. If something's not working after 4-6 weeks, adjust it. Life changes, priorities shift. Just don't change goals every other day — that's procrastination in disguise. Quarterly reviews are a good rhythm for major adjustments."
