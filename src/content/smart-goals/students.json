  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How do I balance academic SMART goals with extracurricular activities?",
      "answer": "Create separate but interconnected goal categories: 2-3 academic goals (grades, skills, projects) and 1-2 extracurricular goals (clubs, sports, volunteering). Use a time-blocking calendar to allocate specific hours for each area. Ensure your goals complement rather than compete—for example, joining the debate club can improve public speaking skills needed for class presentations. Review weekly to maintain balance and adjust if one area consistently suffers."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many SMART goals should a student set per semester?",
      "answer": "Aim for 3-4 goals per semester to maintain focus without overwhelming yourself. Typically, set 2 academic goals (like improving in specific courses or developing study skills), 1 skill development goal (like learning coding or a language), and 1 personal or extracurricular goal. First-year students should start with just 2-3 goals as they adjust to college life. Quality and completion matter more than quantity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best way to track progress on student SMART goals?",
      "answer": "Use a combination of digital and physical tracking methods. Create a simple spreadsheet or use apps like Notion or Todoist to log measurable metrics (study hours, test scores, completed chapters). Keep a weekly reflection journal to note what's working and what needs adjustment. Schedule bi-weekly 15-minute reviews to assess progress against your timeline. Share goals with a study partner or accountability buddy for external motivation and support."
